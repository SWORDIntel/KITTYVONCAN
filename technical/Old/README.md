# Old Documentation Archive

**Date:** 2025-11-22  
**Purpose:** Archive of superseded documentation covering partial system layers

## Contents

This directory contains documentation that has been superseded by complete Layer 3-9 system documentation. These files are preserved for historical reference but should not be used for current system understanding.

### Archived Files

## Why These Files Were Archived

These documents were created during the progressive discovery and activation of the DSMIL system layers. They represent snapshots of system understanding at various stages but do not reflect the complete Layer 3-9 architecture that is now fully documented.

### Complete System Documentation

For current, complete system documentation covering all 104 devices and Layers 3-9, refer to:

1. **COMPLETE_SYSTEM_ACTIVATION_SUMMARY.md** - Full system activation and capabilities
2. **LAYER8_9_AI_ANALYSIS.md** - Comprehensive Layers 8-9 analysis
3. **LAYER8_ACTIVATION.md** - Layer 8 activation details
4. **LAYER9_ACTIVATION.md** - Layer 9 activation details
5. **LAYERS_8_9_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md** - Integration summary
6. **DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md** - Master index of all current documentation

## Historical Value

These documents are preserved because they:
- Show the progression of system discovery
- Contain detailed analysis of individual layers
- Provide historical context for authorization progression
- Document intermediate system states

However, they should **NOT** be used for:
- Current system understanding
- Operational planning
- Capability assessment
- Training materials
